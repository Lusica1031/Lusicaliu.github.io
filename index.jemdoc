== Biography
I am currently senior researcher in EDA Lab, Huawei Hong Kong Research Center. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk the Department of Computer Science and Engineering], [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)], 
under the supervision of [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/ Prof. Bei Yu] on Aug. 2024. 
Before that, I received my B.S. in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from [http://www.hust.edu.cn Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)] in 2020.
My Chinese name is 刘思婷.

I'm serving as the track programme committee member in Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC) 2025 and reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD), ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES), and Integration, the VLSI Journal.
